    <h3>How long does it take to learn piano?</h3>
    <p>Well… It is probably the most challenging question that I have ever had to answer.
      Most adults who contemplate learning how to play the piano, or who have already decided to start, have the same question in mind: “How long does it take to learn piano?”
      It depends.Every time an adult asks me this question, I give the same reply: “It depends”. It depends as it depends on various factors: your exact goal, your natural ability, the amount of time you dedicate to personal practice and the
      instructor you are studying with.
      As you may have probably understood, it is a question that cannot be answered unless one has all the data.

    <h3>The importance of discipline and consistency</h1>
      <p>When learning how to play the piano, you will be required to use both your body and mind in a way that is very different to any other activity. You will then have to teach both how to operate in a unique manner. You will learn
        how to read music, which can be similar to learn a new language, ask your hands and fingers to perform various tasks and synchronise it all.
        Piano playing is much more complicated than this. I am summarizing to make it easy for you to understand.

    <h3>Why do I keep making mistakes?</h1>
      <p>Fingering: often the primary cause of mistakes
        The reason why people often keep making mistakes is because of wrong fingering practised or because of not giving attention to the fingering from the start and they keep changing it.
        Continuously changing fingering creates a problem for your muscle memory.
        Repeat it every time with the same fingering so that you not only remember it with your mind and your ear but also with your fingers and your muscles.

            “Beethoven’s playing differs so greatly from the usual method of treating the piano, that it seems as if he had struck out an entirely new path for himself.” Those are the words of one of Beethoven’s contemporaries, Carl Ludwig Junker. We
            may not have any recordings of Beethoven performing, but we have the virtuosic and inventive music he wrote for the piano and accounts from people who heard him play. The man who is now better known as a composer was much admired for his
            use of legato and the singing tone he was able to produce. </h4>

          <h4 class="method-text"><span>Frédéric Chopin</span> (1810-1849)
            Poland’s most famous composer was also one of the great piano virtuosos of his day. The vast majority of his work was for solo piano and though there are no recordings of him playing (the earliest sound recordings are from the 1860s), one
            contemporary said: “One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be
            compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.” </h4>

            Vying with Chopin for the crown of greatest 19th-century-virtuoso was Franz Liszt, the Hungarian composer, teacher and pianist. Among his best known works are his fiendishly difficult Années de pèlerinage, the Piano Sonata in B minor and
            his Mephisto Waltz. And as a performer his fame was legendary – there was even a word coined for the frenzy he inspired: Lisztomania.</h4>

            [Austria]—died
            December 5, 1791, Vienna), Austrian composer, widely recognized as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music. With Haydn and Beethoven he brought to its height the achievement of the Viennese Classical school. Unlike
            any other composer in musical history, he wrote in all the musical genres of his day and excelled in every one. His taste, his command of form, and his range of expression have made him seem the most universal of all composers.</h4>
